# FlipFrenzy Mini Game -- From Leo Wang
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/FVs1kt4QQQ8
#### Description:
When you launch the program, it creates a 4x4 grid to represent a total of 16 cards, and the game begins.
Players take turns flipping over cards by specifying their positions in the 4x4 grid,
following the 'row, column' format. For example, '1,4' represents selecting the fourth card in the first row.
Players need to select a second card using the same procedure.
If the two selected cards share the same fruit value, they form a match.
The game continues until all card pairs are successfully matched.
To add an element of challenge, I've included a timer to encourage players to match all the cards as quickly as possible.

**Project Structure**:
Now, let's delve into the inner workings of the project. 'FlipFrenzy' consists of four main files:

- ```
  Project.py: This is the core of the project, where the game logic is implemented.
  ```
- ```
  fruits.py: This file provides the list of fruit cards that appear in the game.
  ```
- ```
  game_card.py: Here, you'll find the 'Card' class, which is essential for creating and managing individual cards within the game.
  ```
- ```
  README.md: The README file contains essential information about the project, including instructions for running it and any additional details you might need.
  ```
